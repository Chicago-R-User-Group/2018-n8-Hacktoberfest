Eleanor’s research focuses on the representation of speech and language in the mind.

She will talk about the development of a Shiny app featuring Chicagoland breweries

### Stephen Ziliak will introduce us to the contribution brewing has made to statistics with his latest paper "How large are your G-values?" forthcoming The American Statistician (Fall 2018).
A crisis of validity has emerged from three related crises of science, that is, the crises of statistical significance and complete randomization, of replication, and of reproducibility. The ten principles of Guinnessometrics or G-values outlined here can help. Originally developed and market-tested by William S. Gosset aka “Student” in his job as Head Experimental Brewer at the Guinness Brewery in Dublin, Gosset’s economic and common sense approach to statistical inference and scientific method has been unwisely neglected.

Stephen T. Ziliak is probably best known for his best selling and critically acclaimed book (with Deirdre McCloskey), The Cult of Statistical Significance: How the Standard Error Costs Us Jobs, Justice, and Lives, and numerous essays on "Guinnessometrics," that is, the scientific and statistical legacy of William S. Gosset aka "Student", Guinness’s Oxford-educated brewmaster. Ziliak is Professor of Economics and Faculty Member of the Social Justice Studies Program at Roosevelt University, Conjoint Professor of Business and Law at the University of Newcastle (Australia), Faculty Affiliate in the Graduate Program of Economics at Colorado State University, and Faculty Member of The Angiogenesis Foundation (Cambridge). In 2016 he was a lead contributing author of the ASA Statement on Statistical Significance and P-values, and he is currently co-editing a special issue of The American Statistician on Statistical Inference and Scientific Method in the World Beyond P < 0.05.
